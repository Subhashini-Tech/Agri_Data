PROJECT: AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA
Description: This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing agricultural data spanning the past 50 years. The dataset includes details such as crop types, cultivation areas, production levels, and yield rates. By converting raw data into meaningful visualizations, the project enables users to quickly understand agricultural trends, compare crop performance, and identify key insights. The visual approach ensures clarity, making complex datasets more accessible and helping stakeholders in decision-making, planning, and strategy development.
Technologies Used: Python, SQL, Streamlit, PowerBI
Project Details:
Data Preparation & Preprocessing
•	Analyzed and cleaned the given agricultural dataset.
•	Renamed all column names for better readability and ease of querying in SQL.
•	Converted the maize production values from kilograms (kg) to tons (t) for consistency.
•	Removed irrelevant or unused columns to maintain a clean and optimized dataset.
•	Uploaded the refined dataset into MySQL for structured storage and efficient querying.
SQL Querying
•	Designed SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
•	Queries were structured to answer specific project requirements such as crop production trends, yield comparisons, and top-performing states.
Data Visualization
•	Created interactive visualizations in Streamlit to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience for exploring the dataset.
•	Developed Power BI dashboards by connecting MySQL directly with Power BI.
•	Used SQL queries as the data source for building charts, graphs, and comparative visuals.
•	Published the Power BI report for easy sharing and accessibility.
